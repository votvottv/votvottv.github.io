# Assets for Sponsor 123

## Naming conventions

### General

* Fields are separated by underlines (`_`).
* Language codes use [TPO's convention][]
* `AGENCY` name is optional.
* Always include an english version for a logo, even if that means just copying
  the filename from other translation. This step is needed so [Onion
  Launchpad][] can have a default fallback logo.

### Folders

* Use either `AGENCY` or `PROJECT` to host the assets for a given site.

### Favicons

* Use the following naming scheme for the icons:

        favicon_AGENCY_PROJECT.svg

### Logos

* Use the following naming scheme for the logos:

        logo_AGENCY_SITE_LANG_CODE.svg
